# Symbolically Linked Files/Dirs
I have linked files that should be located else where to this directory and its children.
Some of these programs probably look at the .config directory but o well.

There is a script name `createsyms.py` that can create these symbolic links on a fresh system. `Requires python tested on python3.10`
